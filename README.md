The **SaaS Builder Toolkit for AWS** is an open-source developer toolkit to implement SaaS best practices and increase developer velocity.

It offers a high-level object-oriented abstraction to define SaaS resources on AWS imperatively using the power of modern programming languages. Using SBT’s library of infrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate SaaS best practices in your SaaS application, and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic.

Currently, SBT is available in the following language:

* JavaScript, TypeScript ([Node.js ≥ 14.15.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v14.x/))
  * We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)
<!-- * Python ([Python ≥ 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Java ([Java ≥ 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [Maven ≥ 3.5.4](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi))
* .NET ([.NET ≥ 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))
* Go ([Go ≥ 1.16.4](https://golang.org/)) -->

Third-party Language Deprecation: language version is only supported until its EOL (End Of Life) shared by the vendor or community and is subject to change with prior notice.

-------

SBT is built on top of the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). It offers a number of higher-order constructs (L2, L2.5 and L3) to short-circuit the time required to build SaaS applications. Specifically, SBT attempts to codify several control plane and application plane concepts into reusable components, removing promoting reuse and reducing boilerplate code.

## Getting Started

For a detailed walkthrough, see the [tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#hello_world_tutorial) in the [developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html).

### At a glance

Initialize a CDK project:

```sh
mkdir hello-cdk
cd hello-cdk
cdk init sample-app --language=typescript
```

This creates a sample project looking like this:

```ts
export class HelloCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const queue = new sqs.Queue(this, 'HelloCdkQueue', {
      visibilityTimeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(300)
    });

    const topic = new sns.Topic(this, 'HelloCdkTopic');

    topic.addSubscription(new subs.SqsSubscription(queue));
  }
}
```

Install or update SBT from npm (requires [Node.js ≥ 14.15.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v14.x/)). We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)

```sh
npm install @cdklabs/sbt-aws
```

Add a sample control plane to your application. In the `HelloCdkStack` add the following:

```typescript
const cp = new sbt.ControlPlane(this, 'control-plane', {
  idpName: 'COGNITO',
  systemAdminRoleName: 'SystemAdmin',
  systemAdminEmail: 'admin@example.com',
  applicationPlaneEventSource: 'sbt-application-plane-api',
  provisioningDetailType: 'Onboarding',
  controlPlaneEventSource: 'sbt-control-plane-api',
  onboardingDetailType: 'Onboarding',
  offboardingDetailType: 'Offboarding',
});
```

Deploy this to your account:

```sh
cdk deploy
```
