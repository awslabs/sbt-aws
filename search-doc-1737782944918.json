If you wish to add Flows or SDK/API based authentication methods to your app, you can follow our Quickstart guide.  Step 5: Usage Examples  Example 1: Implementing User Login with Passwordless Authentication Using Descope​  Descope's passwordless authentication provides a flexible, highly secure way to log in without traditional passwords, reducing the risk of phishing attacks and enhancing user convenience. With Descope, you can offer users a range of secure, passwordless login options, including passkeys, social login, and magic links—all of which improve security while simplifying the user experience.  Passkeys: Passkeys use a combination of device-based biometric verification (like fingerprint or Face ID) and cryptographic methods to authenticate users. This approach allows users to log in using only their device, without needing to enter any passwords. Implementing passkeys with Descope is straightforward, requiring only the user's consent to set up the device-based authentication. Passkeys are stored securely on the user's device, providing a phishing-resistant method of authentication that is seamless and familiar.Social Login: Descope supports a variety of social login providers, allowing users to authenticate via platforms they already use, like Google, Apple, or Facebook. This method enhances convenience while still ensuring a secure authentication process, as it reduces the need to create and remember yet another password.Magic Link: Magic links provide users with a one-time link sent directly to their email. When clicked, it logs the user in without requiring a password, making the process not only user-friendly but also resistant to phishing attacks. Since magic links are sent to the user's verified email, they ensure that the person logging in is indeed the account holder.  Benefits: Descope's passwordless options help prevent phishing by eliminating traditional passwords and offering cryptographic alternatives that are more secure. The variety of login methods allows you to choose the best option based on your application's user demographics and risk model, ensuring both security and convenience.  Example 2: Configuring multi-tenant user management to allow organization-specific login settings and access policies​  In a multi-tenant SaaS environment, organizations often have unique authentication needs, such as specific Single Sign-On (SSO) policies, access roles, and authorization rules. Descope enables you to manage each organization separately, providing customized login settings and role-based access control for each tenant.  SSO Self-Service Configuration: Descope enables tenant admins to configure SSO independently through a dedicated link. Once generated, this link lets an admin configure SSO settings, such as setting up SAML or OAuth integrations, without needing assistance from developers. Example Workflow: You can generate a self-service SSO link specific to the tenant, which can be shared with the tenant admin.Tenant Admin SSO Configuration: When the tenant admin accesses the link, they can complete the setup of SSO by following simple on-screen instructions. They can choose their identity provider, configure SAML assertions, and save the settings, allowing users within that tenant to log in through their chosen provider. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): With Descope's tenant-level RBAC, you can assign users different roles based on the tenant's requirements, as well as map them from SAML groups that come from various external IdPs. For example, some users might have admin access, while others have read-only access. These roles can be configured on a per-tenant basis, allowing for flexible access control.Custom Tenant Authentication: Descope lets you configure different flow behaviors and styling per tenant, including MFA requirements, password settings, and device trust. This allows you to implement granular security controls based on the tenant's risk profile, such as requiring MFA for certain users.

In this workshop, you will walk through the development of a multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution using the SaaS Builder Toolkit for AWS (SBT). SBT is an open-source toolkit designed to streamline and accelerate the development of SaaS applications by encapsulating best practices and common patterns into reusable components. As SaaS continues to dominate the software delivery model, the ability to rapidly deploy and scale applications becomes increasingly crucial. SBT utilizes the robust AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to provide developers with high-level object-oriented abstractions, enabling a focus on building unique features rather than managing the underlying infrastructure. This workshop guide is structured into five comprehensive labs (with two optional ones), each aimed at enhancing your understanding and skills in utilizing the SBT to its full potential. By the end of this workshop, you will have built a fully functional SaaS application. It's important to note that prior knowledge of SBT is not required for this workshop. Instead, you can use this workshop as a step-by-step guide to gain a deeper understanding of the SBT components, enhancing your ability to effectively utilize these tools in building scalable SaaS solutions.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Congratulations!","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/sbt-aws/docs/tutorials/tutorial-basics/congratulations","content":"Congratulations!","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Application plane utilities","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/sbt-aws/docs/tutorials/tutorial-basics/app-plane-utils","content":"Application plane utilities Although entirely optional, SBT includes a utility that lets you define, and run arbitrary jobs upon receipt of a control plane message, called a ScriptJob. This mechanism is extended to produce two new helper constructs ProvisioningScriptJob and DeprovisioningScriptJob which are used for onboarding and off-boarding, respectively, in the reference architectures which were ported to SBT (see references at the end of this document). That tenant provisioning/deprovisioning process is depicted below: Notice the use of the provisioning.sh and deprovisioning.sh scripts at the top. These scripts are fed to the ProvisioningScriptJob and DeprovisioningScriptJob as parameters. Internally the ScriptJob launches an AWS CodeBuild project, wrapped inside an AWS Step Function, to execute the bash scripts. The ScriptJob also lets you specify what input variables to feed to the scripts, along with what output variables you expect them to return. Note that in this version of SBT, you can create the ScriptJob construct with ScriptJobProps and configure CoreAppPlane with ScriptJobs using its scriptJobs property. The CoreAppPlane will then link these ScriptJobs to EventBridge. Let's take a simple example: imagine our SaaS application deployed only a single S3 bucket per tenant. Let's create a ProvisioningScriptJob for that provisioning now: const scriptJobProps: TenantLifecycleScriptJobProps = { permissions: PolicyDocument.fromJson(/*See below*/), script: '' /*See below*/, environmentStringVariablesFromIncomingEvent: ['tenantId', 'tier'], environmentVariablesToOutgoingEvent: ['tenantS3Bucket', 'someOtherVariable', 'tenantConfig'], scriptEnvironmentVariables: { TEST: 'test', }, eventManager: eventManager /*See below on how to create EventManager*/, }; Key\tType\tPurposescript\tstring\tA string in bash script format that represents the job to be run (example below) permissions\tPolicyDocument\tAn IAM policy document giving this job the IAM permissions it needs to do what it's being asked to do environmentStringVariablesFromIncomingEvent\tstring[]\tThe environment variables to import into the ScriptJob from event details field. environmentVariablesToOutgoingEvent\tstring[]\tThe environment variables to export into the outgoing event once the ScriptJob has finished. scriptEnvironmentVariables\t{ [key: string]: string }\tThe variables to pass into the codebuild ScriptJob. eventManager\tIEventManager\tThe EventManager instance that allows connecting to events flowing between the Control Plane and other components. The heavy lifting of the ScriptJob construct (along with constructs that extend it like ProvisioningScriptJob) happens with the value of the script key. Let's take a look at the example provisioning script now: echo &quot;starting...&quot; # note that this template.json is being created here, but # it could just as easily be pulled in from an S3 bucket. cat &gt; template.json &lt;&lt; EOM { &quot;AWSTemplateFormatVersion&quot;: &quot;2010-09-09&quot;, &quot;Resources&quot;: {&quot;MyBucket&quot;: {&quot;Type&quot;: &quot;AWS::S3::Bucket&quot;}}, &quot;Outputs&quot;: {&quot;S3Bucket&quot;: {&quot;Value&quot;: { &quot;Ref&quot;: &quot;MyBucket&quot; }}} } EOM echo &quot;tenantId: $tenantId&quot; echo &quot;tier: $tier&quot; aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name &quot;tenantTemplateStack-\\${tenantId}&quot; --template-body &quot;file://template.json&quot; aws cloudformation wait stack-create-complete --stack-name &quot;tenantTemplateStack-\\${tenantId}&quot; export tenantS3Bucket=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name &quot;tenantTemplateStack-\\${tenantId}&quot; | jq -r '.Stacks[0].Outputs[0].OutputValue') export someOtherVariable=&quot;this is a test&quot; echo $tenantS3Bucket export tenantConfig=$(jq --arg SAAS_APP_USERPOOL_ID &quot;MY_SAAS_APP_USERPOOL_ID&quot; \\ --arg SAAS_APP_CLIENT_ID &quot;MY_SAAS_APP_CLIENT_ID&quot; \\ --arg API_GATEWAY_URL &quot;MY_API_GATEWAY_URL&quot; \\ -n '{&quot;userPoolId&quot;:$SAAS_APP_USERPOOL_ID,&quot;appClientId&quot;:$SAAS_APP_CLIENT_ID,&quot;apiGatewayUrl&quot;:$API_GATEWAY_URL}') echo $tenantConfig export tenantStatus=&quot;created&quot; echo &quot;done!&quot; ","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Create the application plane","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/sbt-aws/docs/tutorials/tutorial-basics/create-application-plane","content":"Create the application plane As mentioned before, SBT is unopinionated about the application in which it's deployed. As a result, we expect you to create the ApplicationPlane construct as just another part of the CDK constructs that you'd use to define your application. Take this simple (non-functional) example: export interface AppPlaneProps extends cdk.StackProps { eventManager: sbt.IEventManager; } export class ApplicationPlaneStack extends Stack { constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: AppPlaneProps) { super(scope, id, props); new sbt.CoreApplicationPlane(this, 'CoreApplicationPlane', { eventManager: props.eventManager, scriptJobs: [], }); } } In this example we're creating the application plane of SBT, and passing in an EventManager created using the same EventBus that we used in our control plane. This will ensure that both planes are wired to the same events in Amazon EventBridge. What's missing in this example is the subscription to EventBridge events, and the acting upon those subscriptions. As an application plane developer, a builder could hook up listeners to the various events published by the control plane, and do what's asked in the event. For example, the onboarding event is sent by the control plane with the expectation that the application plane provisions new tenant resources. The event's payload should carry enough information for the application to complete its job. Once done, it's expected that the app plane sends back a status event indicating success or failure. Again, SBT allows builders to publish and subscribe directly to EventBridge, and does not attempt to interfere with that process. However, as part of the SBT library we've published a set of utilities to assist with typical application plane workflows. Let's look one of those utilities now. Once done, we'll come back to this code and fill it in with what we learned.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Create the control plane","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/sbt-aws/docs/tutorials/tutorial-basics/create-control-plane","content":"Create the control plane Now that we have SBT installed, let's create a new SBT control plane.

Remember that the ScriptJob (which is used to extend the ProvisioningScriptJob construct) creates an AWS CodeBuild project internally. When the ScriptJob creates the CodeBuild project, it can specify what environment variables to provide. The ScriptJob utility is also triggered by an EventBridge message matching the criteria specified in the incomingEvent parameter of the ScriptJobProps. (You don't need to worry about doing that for ProvisioningScriptJob and DeprovisioningScriptJob because that is already configured.) The message that arrives via EventBridge has a detail JSON Object (see docs here) that carries with it contextual information included by the sender, in our case, the control plane. For each key in the environmentStringVariablesFromIncomingEvent object, the ScriptJob extracts the value of a matching key found in the EventBridge message's detail JSON object, and provides that value to the CodeBuild project as an environment variable.  So, take for example, this sample EventBridge provisioning message sent by a control plane:  { &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;6a7e8feb-b491-4cf7-a9f1-bf3703467718&quot;, &quot;detail-type&quot;: &quot;onboardingRequest&quot;, &quot;source&quot;: &quot;controlPlaneEventSource&quot;, &quot;account&quot;: &quot;111122223333&quot;, &quot;time&quot;: &quot;2017-12-22T18:43:48Z&quot;, &quot;region&quot;: &quot;us-west-1&quot;, &quot;resources&quot;: [&quot;arn:aws:ec2:us-west-1:123456789012:instance/i-1234567890abcdef0&quot;], &quot;detail&quot;: { &quot;tenantId&quot;: &quot;e6878e03-ae2c-43ed-a863-08314487318b&quot;, &quot;tier&quot;: &quot;standard&quot; } }   When executing, the script cited above would echo both tenantId and tier with the values set according to this message.
