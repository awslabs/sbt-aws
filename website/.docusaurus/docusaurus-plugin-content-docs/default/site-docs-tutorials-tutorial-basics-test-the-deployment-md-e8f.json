When you deployed the control plane, you should've received an email with temporary admin credentials. Let's use those credentials now to log in to that account. Please replace the placeholder ('INSERT PASSWORD HERE') with your temporary password in the script below. Once logged in, this script will onboard a new tenant, and retrieve its details. Note this script uses the jq JSON processor.",
