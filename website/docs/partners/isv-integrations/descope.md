```typescript
import { DescopeAuth } from "sbt-aws-descope";

const descopeAuth = new DescopeAuth(this, "DescopeAuth", {
      projectId: "<<Descope Project ID>>",
      clientSecretSSMMgmtKey: "<<Parameter Name in SSM of Descope Management Key",
});

const controlPlane = new sbt.ControlPlane(this, "ControlPlane", {
      auth: descopeAuth,
      systemAdminEmail: "kevin@descope.com",
});
```

**Step 5**: Usage Examples
- ### Example 1: Implementing User Login with Passwordless Authentication Using Descope

Descope's passwordless authentication provides a flexible, highly secure way to log in without traditional passwords, reducing the risk of phishing attacks and enhancing user convenience. With Descope, you can offer users a range of secure, passwordless login options, including passkeys, social login, and magic links—all of which improve security while simplifying the user experience.

- **Passkeys**: Passkeys use a combination of device-based biometric verification (like fingerprint or Face ID) and cryptographic methods to authenticate users. This approach allows users to log in using only their device, without needing to enter any passwords. Implementing passkeys with Descope is straightforward, requiring only the user's consent to set up the device-based authentication. Passkeys are stored securely on the user's device, providing a phishing-resistant method of authentication that is seamless and familiar.
- **Social Login**: Descope supports a variety of social login providers, allowing users to authenticate via platforms they already use, like Google, Apple, or Facebook. This method enhances convenience while still ensuring a secure authentication process, as it reduces the need to create and remember yet another password.
- **Magic Link**: Magic links provide users with a one-time link sent directly to their email. When clicked, it logs the user in without requiring a password, making the process not only user-friendly but also resistant to phishing attacks. Since magic links are sent to the user's verified email, they ensure that the person logging in is indeed the account holder.

**Benefits**: Descope's passwordless options help prevent phishing by eliminating traditional passwords and offering cryptographic alternatives that are more secure. The variety of login methods allows you to choose the best option based on your application's user demographics and risk model, ensuring both security and convenience.

- ### Example 2: Configuring multi-tenant user management to allow organization-specific login settings and access policies

In a multi-tenant SaaS environment, organizations often have unique authentication needs, such as specific Single Sign-On (SSO) policies, access roles, and authorization rules. Descope enables you to manage each organization separately, providing customized login settings and role-based access control for each tenant.

- **SSO Self-Service Configuration**: Descope enables tenant admins to configure SSO independently through a dedicated link. Once generated, this link lets an admin configure SSO settings, such as setting up SAML or OAuth integrations, without needing assistance from developers.
  - **Example Workflow**:
    1. You can generate a self-service SSO link specific to the tenant, which can be shared with the tenant admin.
    2. **Tenant Admin SSO Configuration**: When the tenant admin accesses the link, they can complete the setup of SSO by following simple on-screen instructions. They can choose their identity provider, configure SAML assertions, and save the settings, allowing users within that tenant to log in through their chosen provider.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: With Descope's tenant-level RBAC, you can assign users different roles based on the tenant's requirements, as well as map them from SAML groups that come from various external IdPs. For example, some users might have admin access, while others have read-only access. These roles can be configured on a per-tenant basis, allowing for flexible access control.
- **Custom Tenant Authentication**: Descope lets you configure different flow behaviors and styling per tenant, including MFA requirements, password settings, and device trust. This allows you to implement granular security controls based on the tenant's risk profile, such as requiring MFA for certain users.

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues and Solutions**:

- **Issue**: "User Management functions or Initial SBT plugin setup and configuration failing."
  - **Solution**: Verify your Descope Management Key and permissions.
- **Issue**: "Access denied errors when accessing SBT control plane."
  - **Solution**: Ensure the Descope plugin is properly installed and referenced in your SBT configuration.
