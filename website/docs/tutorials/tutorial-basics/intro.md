# Tutorial Intro

This tutorial will walk you through creating a basic multi-tenant application using SaaS
Builder Toolkit. 

## Introduction



### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) version XX or above:
  - Directions for installing are [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install)

## Step 1: CDK getting started

Follow the instructions in CDK's getting started guide. This guide walks you through installing the pre-requisites
and ensuring your environment is prepared to build your first CDK app.

## Step 2: Hello SBT!

Follow the instructions in [**Step One** of CDK's "Hello CDK" project](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/hello_world.html#hello_world_create).

You don't have to build or deploy the project, just initialize a new empty project. Once done, come back here,
and we'll get started with building your first SBT-enabled multi-tenant app.
