# SaaS Builder Toolkit (SBT) AWS Workshop

This workshop guide provides a hands-on learning experience for developing multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions using the open-source SaaS Builder Toolkit (SBT) for AWS. By leveraging Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), you will streamline the development, deployment, and scalability of SaaS applications.

The guide will provide detailed instructions, code samples, and hands-on exercises to guide you through the process of building a multi-tenant SaaS solution using the SBT AWS and ECS.

## Overview

The SBT AWS is designed to accelerate the development of SaaS applications by encapsulating best practices and common patterns into reusable components. As the SaaS delivery model continues to gain prominence, the ability to rapidly deploy and scale applications becomes increasingly crucial. The SBT utilizes the robust AWS CDK to provide developers with high-level object-oriented abstractions, allowing them to focus on building unique features rather than managing the underlying infrastructure.

## Workshop Structure

This workshop is structured into five comprehensive labs, each designed to enhance your understanding and skills in utilizing the SBT AWS to its full potential. By the end of the workshop, you will have built a fully functional SaaS application, similar to the one outlined in the ECS SaaS Reference Architecture. Prior knowledge of this reference architecture is not required, as the workshop serves as a step-by-step guide to gain a deeper understanding of both the SBT components and the ECS SaaS Reference Architecture.
